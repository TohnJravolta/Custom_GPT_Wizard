# Custom GPT Wizard (CGW) - Knowledge Repository Changelog



## Version 0.0.42 December 14, 2023

A devlog on a large part of the process of having GPT iterate on its own instructions for developing the new "EGBA" feature that replaces the stock build assistant:
https://github.com/TohnJravolta/Explore/blob/main/CGW_Self_Improvement.ipynb

### Added

- /M as a shorter version of /Make
- New folders and documentation to the knowledge base
- clarification on the slash commands being case sensitive (unplanned consequence, might make it easier for users to remember the commands), CGW will be expecting an ALL CAPS INPUT ie. /MAKE
- Experimental "mood altering" instructions to the CGWs builder instruction field (BIF)
- Expanded User-Centric Design Templates: Added a variety of templates and examples for GPT design, catering to a broader range of user needs and preferences.

### Changed
- **Updated Feedback Mechanism**: Improved feedback form link for more effective user communication and response collection.
- Enhanced EGBA Workflow: The step-by-step guide in EGBA mode has been refined for clarity and efficiency, making the custom GPT creation process more intuitive and streamlined.
- Dynamic Feedback Integration: Updated the feedback mechanism within EGBA to be more responsive and adaptive, allowing real-time adjustments based on user inputs.
- Knowledge Base Extension: Further expansion of the knowledge database to include the latest trends, research, and use cases in the GPT domain.
- General Github/ Knowledge Base Maintenance and improvements.

### Fixed
- **EGBA Mode**: Fixes and adds major optimization to the process/ framework (major refactoring done to the INSTRUCTION set to improve readability for both CGW and humans + user input error fixes).

### Deprecated
- Outdated instruction sets.
- Legacy Feedback Mechanisms: Phased out older feedback methods in favor of more dynamic and interactive systems.
- Outmoded Instructional Content: Removed instructional content that no longer reflects the current state of GPT technology and user needs.

### Security
- Project published its open source instruction set to make its process transparent for users and to help keep it secure.

https://github.com/TohnJravolta/Explore/blob/main/CGW_Self_Improvement.ipynb

### Added

- **EGBA Mode**: Addition of Enhanced GPT Builder Assistant (EGBA) mode, providing an in improved replacement for the standard GPT builder assistant with a step-by-step guide for custom GPT creation and optimization. try /make (try your GPT idea here without the parenthesis)

### Changed
- **Updated Feedback Mechanism**: Improved feedback form link for more effective user communication and response collection.
- **Updated Knowledge**: Updated and expanded knowledge database to include most up to date official articles on GPTs from openAI.
- **Optimized User-Centric Design Instructions**: Refined advice on aligning GPT design with user preferences, ensuring higher satisfaction and engagement.

### Fixed
- Typos in the instruction set.
- Updates to the configuration advice for better alignment with latest GPT model capabilities and features.

### Deprecated
- Outdated use cases and examples that no longer align with the current capabilities of GPT models or user requirements.

### Security
- Emphasized the importance of privacy and security compliance in the development and deployment of custom GPTs.
