## Introduction
### Bridging Human Ingenuity and AI Potential
Custom GPT Wizard (CGW) was originally conceived as a collective intelligence experiment. In 2025 it continues that mission by helping builders translate ideas into production-ready GPTs that comply with OpenAI's latest Workspace policies, monetize through the refreshed GPT Store, and document their approach for teammates. This wiki distills lessons from CGW sessions, community contributions, and the continually evolving official documentation catalogue.

## FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions about CGW offer insights into its functionalities, usage, and capabilities. This section aims to clarify common queries and enhance user understanding of CGW.

### What is Custom GPT Wizard (CGW)?
CGW is a tool designed to allow users to create customized versions of ChatGPT, known as GPTs. These custom models are tailored to specific tasks or interests, leveraging the power of GPT-4 technology.

### Who can use CGW?
CGW is available to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Enterprise users who can open custom GPTs on chatgpt.com. Team and Enterprise builders gain additional controls—such as Workspace analytics, admin-managed data retention, and centralized billing—that CGW will reference when suggesting governance steps.

### How does CGW work?
CGW guides you through configuring and personalizing GPT models. Users can set layered instructions, upload Knowledge files, pick conversation starters, toggle capabilities such as web browsing, DALL·E, and code interpreter, and wire up external Actions. The wizard mirrors OpenAI's builder UI so you can copy/paste its plans directly into the latest interface.

### What are GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o custom models?
GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o are OpenAI's flagship multimodal models powering custom GPTs in 2025. CGW assumes these baselines when generating instructions, but it will call out when a lightweight model (GPT-4o mini) or a specialized Team/Enterprise option (such as higher rate limits) might better fit your deployment goals.

### How can CGW be applied in real-world scenarios?
CGW finds applications in various domains like education (for personalized tutoring), business (for customer service and analytics), and creative industries (for content creation and ideation).

### Is CGW easy to use for those without a technical background?
CGW is designed with user-friendliness in mind. It features an intuitive interface and guidance, making it accessible even to users without a technical background.

### Can CGW integrate with other systems and APIs?
Yes. CGW produces action schemas that align with the 2025 GPT Actions quickstart. It will recommend authentication patterns (OAuth vs. API key), security scopes, and post-deployment monitoring so you can safely connect third-party APIs to your GPT.

### How does CGW ensure data privacy and security?
CGW emphasizes privacy and security best practices from OpenAI's documentation, including respecting Workspace-level data retention settings, disabling the "Allow my GPT to be used for model improvement" toggle when handling sensitive data, and cataloging Knowledge file owners and review cadences. The wizard also suggests consent language and audit logging habits for regulated industries.

### How do I monetize my GPT with the 2025 GPT Store?
CGW references the GPT Store overview, builder profile requirements, and revenue share policies. It will help you prepare marketing assets, ensure your builder profile is verified, write changelog entries for each release, and interpret analytics signals such as conversations, saves, and Workspace conversions.

### What changed in the builder during 2024–2025?
OpenAI introduced a side-by-side builder preview, consolidated capability toggles, improved testing for Actions, Workspace visibility controls, and a metrics dashboard. CGW's latest prompts and slash commands assume this layout so builders can move seamlessly between the wizard's plan and the official UI.

### How do Workspace roles affect custom GPT projects?
Admins can manage billing, enforce data retention, and publish Workspace-wide GPTs. Builders author and update GPTs, while analysts view analytics without editing instructions. CGW will flag when you need an admin to approve Actions or when analytics-only access is sufficient for stakeholders.

### What future developments are expected for CGW?
The roadmap focuses on deeper Workspace integrations (webhooks, granular capability toggles), richer analytics exports, and expanded monetization guidance. Expect CGW prompts and templates to evolve alongside those official updates so teams can adopt them on day one.
